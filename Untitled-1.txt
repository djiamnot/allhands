to do for FACT:

// send ip address of each node to the server on start. 
the server keeps these in an array, pushing it to kavi's machine every 5 seconds. 
// have the fact patch be able to request the ip locations

// add an opt-out button to prevent their location from being tracked

/iplocation name ipaddress lat long timezone continent country_code country

// add a vanilla-max-based reverb to fact.maxpat
